GITHUB:

GITHUB is a centralized web based platform which is used to store and share the source code

How to push files to GITHUB:

 . Commit some files in local
 
 . Now link github repo to local system : git remote add origin    github- url

 -> Now push the source code to github:

    Then it will ask username: provide github username
    Now it will ask password: generate a token and paste here

 -> How to generate token: settings >>>>>> developer settings >>>> personal access token >>>> generate a token >>>> name: developer settings >>>> personal access token >> geenrate a token >>> name:>>>> scoper : repositories

 . git push -u origin master 

 . to push multiple branches at a time: git push -u origin branch1 branch2 branch3
 
 . (to push all branches: git push -u origin --all)

 .  username:

 .  password:         (token)(It will not be visible)

 with token we can either push or clone

 .To know what are the repo that we connected to github: git remote -v 

 . To pull the commits from the central(GITHUB):  git pull origin master(branch name)

(Alternative way: Git pull = fetch + merge)
(fetch: checks whether there are changes in central)
( if changes are present then we will merge to local)
( Merge: Getting the changes from github)

. git fetch origin master(branch name)

. git merge origin/master(branch name)
