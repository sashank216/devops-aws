

2 IP Address

1. Public IP: To access the applications through internet(Which are running in that server)
IT is also used to connect the instance

2. Private IP: To access the application within the server



To modify the volume user selects the instance and gets into storage and clicks on volume id and modifies the volume

(Volume gb can be modified for once in every six hours)

So create another volume and attch the volume( Availability zones should be same)

One Instance can have as many security groups it has

Without stopping instance - Instance type cannot be stopped

Instance stop->Actions->Instance Settings->Change Instance type->Select->Start


INSTANCE MODIFICATIONS:

NAME TAGS

VOLUME 

SECURITY GROUPS

INSTANCE TYPE(CPU AND RAM OF INSTANCE)

KEYPAIR:

When we launch an instance with keypair, it generates 2 keys

1. PUBLIC KEY (LOCAL SYSTEM)

2. PRIVATE KEY (LOCAL SYSTEM)

WHEN YOU WANT TO CONNECT YOUR INSTANCE THE PUBLIC KEY WILL HAVE TO MATCH WITH PRIVATE KEY, THE PUBLIC KEY WILL HAVE TO MATCH WITH PRIVATE KEY

IF WE CREATE AN INSTANCE WITH KEY-PAIR, WE CAN CONNECT OUR INSTANCE ON MULTIPLE WAYS

1. CONSOLE (WITH KEY PAIR OR WITHOUT KEY)

2. TERMINAL (WITH KEY-PAIR) - IT IS USED CONNECT THE LINUX MACHINES

EX: PUTTY, MOBAXTREM

TYPES OF KEY-PAIRS: 

. RSA - SUPPORTS ALL OS TYPES - (IN REAL TIME)

. ED25519 - DOES NOT SUPPORT ON WINDOWS

PRIVATE KEY FILE FORMAT:

.pem
.ppk

WHY TERMINAL OVER CONSOLE: SPEED AND PERFORMANCE

ONE KEY-PAIR CAN BE USED FOR MANY SERVERS

PPK ---> PUTTY(DOES NOT SUPPORT PEM FILE) (PUTTY PRIVATE KEY)

PEM ---> MOBAXTREM(DOES NOT SUPPORT PPK FILE) (PRIVACY ENHANCED KEY0

CAN CONVERT PEM->PPK FILE(THROUGH PUTTY GEN) BUT CANNOT CONVERT PPK->PEM

REAL TIME ONLY PEM IS USED
