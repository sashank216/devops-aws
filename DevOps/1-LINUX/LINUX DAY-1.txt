LINUX DAY-1

Linux - It is a free and open-source os with high security. Linux is multi user based OS

Operating System:

An OS is a software that acts as an interface b/w computer hardware components and the user.

Every computer system must have at least one os to run other programs
Applications like browsers, MS office , notepad games etc,need some environment to run and perform
its tasks

The os helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how
to speak the computer's language, it is not possible

Types:

Kernel:    Manages the hardware components, cpu, memory, and peripheral devices.
           The kernel is the lowest level of the os

Daemons:   Manages background services(printing sound, scheduling, etc) that either 
           start up during boot or after you log into desktop

Shell:     It is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs and shell
           scripts. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input.
           When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.


Linux OS Distributions

Many of the users taken the linux OS modified according to their requirements and releases
into the market with different names called Linux distribution.

.RedHat---
.Ubuntu---
.Debian
.Centos---
.Fedora
.Opensuse
.Kali Linux - mainly used by ethical hackers and cyberscurity
.Amazon Linux---
.Rocky Linux

--Shell(to run the code or application)

--Kernel(inside shell there is Kernel)

--Hardware(Inside Kernel haardware components are present)------------> . Terminals  .Printers . Discs

Shell:

. A shell is a program that serves as an interface b/w the user and the
  OS. It provides a way for users to interact with the computer by accepting commands and then 
  executing them.

. Shells to be graphical(GUI-based), where users interact with the computer
  though windows , icons, buttons, or they can be command-line-based, where
  users type text commands into a terminal

  CLI : Command line interface (only text based)
  GUI: Graphical user interface(icons buttons etc)

Linux Types of Commands

. System commands
. Hardware commands
. Network commands
. File commands
. Search commands
. User commands
. Permission commands

.Whenever you connect with instance , we login as ec2-user,
 EC2-user is the default user in amazon-linux
But we have to login as root user

Because Root user is the ultimate king of the linux
to login from ec2-user to root user

commands:
sudo -i (or) sudo su -
sudo = super user do

To logout from root user
command: exit


System Commands:

To know the os of the system: uname
To know the kernel version of the os: uname -r
To know the full info of the system: uname -a
To know the spending time and running state and the load average on the system: uptime
To know only time: uptime -p
To know about date and time of our system run time: uptime -s
To clear the screen: ctrl+L
To know the private dns name of the server: hostname
To get the ipaddress: hostname -i
To get the ip address: ip addr , ip route, if config

______________________________________ 
Note: ip config( for windows system)  |
For public address no command         |
(because we know the public ip addr)  |
_____________________________________ |

In real time: user@projectdetails/env details/client details

To change the hostname: hostnamectl set-hostname ust-swiggy-dev

logout and login
exit
sudo -i

To know the date: date
To know only the date: date +"%d"
To know the month: date +"%m"
To know the year: date +"%y"
To know the time(hours): date +"%H"
To know the time(minutes): date +"%M"
To know the time(seconds): date +"%S"
To know the whole format: date +"%D"
To change the whole format: date +"%F"
To know the day: date +"%A"
To know the month: date +"%B"
To know which user we are logged in: whoami
To know the user's login and other details: who
To know the timezone of our system: timedatectl
To change the time in the system: timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware commands:

cpu information: cat /proc/cpuinfo
cat ---> It is a linux command which isused to read the data in a file
proc ---> it is a directory which contains processor of our system
cpuinfo ----> it is a file which contains cpu info

Alternative: lscpu


To know the ram information: cat /proc/meminfo

To get RAM info in KB: free

To convert data into MB: free -m

To get storage info about our system: df -h
 
To get list volumes attched to our system: fdisk -l
