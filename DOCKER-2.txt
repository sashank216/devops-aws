DOCKER -2

POINTS TO BE FOLLOWED:

. YOU CAN'T USE DOCKER DIRECTLY, YOU NEED TO START/RESTART FIRST(OBSERVER THE DOCKER VERSION BEFORE AND AFTER RESTART)

. YOU NEED A BASE IMAGE FOR CREATING A CONTAINER.

. YOU CAN'T ENTER DIRECTLY TO CONTAINER, YOU NEED TO START FIRST.

. IF YOU RUN AN IMAGE, BY DEFAULY ONE CONTAINER WILL CREATE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

. sudo -i

. yum install docker -y

. systemctl status docker

. systemctl start docker

. docker version ( to know the version of the docker )

. docker info ( to analyze the full information of the docker)

. docker images ( Used to list of images)

. docker pull ubuntu ( Used to pull the images)

. docker ps -a ( list of containers) ps(processors)

. docker run -it --name contname ubuntu (create the container)(-it(shell which is used to perform the commands and which is used to run the applications (interactive terminal))

. ls (list of files)

. exit (to get out from the container)

. to again get into the container

. start the docker = docker start contname

. docker attach contname

. Without using exit user can exist from the container without stoppinh
 [ctrl+p+q]

. docker ps -a

[User can observe now that the container is still in upstate]

ex:

docker run -it --name cont-1 ubuntu

ctrl+p+q

docker ps -a


To observe only running containers:

docker ps


To stop the container:

docker stop contid


To observe only stopped containers:

docker ps -f "status=exited"  (-f = filter)


To delete the container:

docker rm contid ( running containers cannot be deleted, to delete the co ntainer stop the container and delete the container)

ex:

docker run -it --name cont-2 ubuntu

docker run -it --name cont-3 ubuntu

docker run -it --name cont-4 ubuntu

docker run -it --name cont-5 ubuntu

]docker stop cont-2 cont-3 cont-4

] docker stop $(docker ps) ( to stop all the containers)

] docker start cont-2 cont-3 cont-4

] docker start $(docker ps -a) ( to start all the containers)

] docker ps -a

To rename the containers:
ex:

docker rename cont-1 cont-1111

docker rename cont-2 cont-2222


To immediately stop the container:

docker kill contname

KILL -> DOCKER CLIENT PASSES  SSIGKILL SIGNAL TO DAEAMON

STOP -> DOCKER CLIENT PASSES  SIGTERM SIGNAL TO DAEAMON


ALTERNATIVE COMMANDS:

docker container ls -a (list of containers)

docker container ls (list of runnig containers)

docker ps -n 2 (top 2 latest containers)

docker container ls -a -n 2 (top 2 latest containers)

docker container ls --latest


Remove all the exited containers:

docker container rm $(docker ls -a) (to remove the all exited contaners)


To know the size of container:

docker container ls -s
